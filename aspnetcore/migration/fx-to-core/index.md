# Migrate from ASP.NET Framework to ASP.NET Core

:::moniker range=">= aspnetcore-6.0"

## Start here: Choose your migration path

Your ASP.NET Framework application can successfully move to ASP.NET Core. The key is choosing the right approach for your specific situation.

### Quick decision guide

**For most production applications:** Use the [**incremental migration approach**](xref:migration/fx-to-core/inc/overview) - it's safer, faster to start, and keeps your app running in production throughout the process.

**For smaller applications or greenfield rewrites:** Consider the complete migration approach using our specialized guides.

## The incremental approach: Best for most teams

Most non-trivial ASP.NET Framework applications should use incremental migration. This approach:

- **Keeps your current app running** while you migrate piece by piece
- **Reduces risk** by moving functionality gradually
- **Delivers value faster** with immediate deployment of migrated components
- **Uses proven tools** like YARP proxy and System.Web adapters

- **Cross-platform**: Deploy on Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **Modern features**: Built-in dependency injection, configuration, and logging
- **Cloud-ready**: Optimized for containers and microservices
- **Future-proof**: Regular updates and long-term support
